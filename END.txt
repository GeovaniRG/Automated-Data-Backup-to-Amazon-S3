This concludes the steps for the project. If you have implemented all of the steps, you should now have a functional and robust backup process for your AWS environment that includes features 
such as error handling, compression, encryption, versioning, performance optimization, monitoring, testing, 
and maintenance.

Having a solid backup process in place is essential for protecting your data and ensuring that you can 
recover quickly from any data loss or corruption. Good luck with your project and happy coding!
