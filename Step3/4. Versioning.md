Versioning in the backup script:

Here's an example of how you can add versioning to the backup script:

```
import boto3
import sys
import gzip

s3 = boto3.client("s3")

bucket_name = "your-bucket-name"
file_name = "backup.txt"
compressed_file_name = "backup.txt.gz"

try:
    with open(file_name, "rb") as f_in:
        with gzip.open(compressed_file_name, "wb") as f_out:
            f_out.writelines(f_in)
    
    s3.put_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=compressed_file_name, Body=open(compressed_file_name, "rb"))
    print("Backup successful")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: Backup file not found")
    sys.exit(1)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    sys.exit(1)
```

In this example, the script uses the s3.put_object method to upload the compressed backup file to S3. By default, S3 stores multiple versions of an object, so you don't need to write any additional code to enable versioning.

By using versioning, you can keep multiple versions of the backup data in S3, which can be useful if you need to revert to an earlier version of the data in case of data loss or corruption. With versioning enabled, you can restore an earlier version of the backup data at any time, without having to worry about losing more recent versions of the data. This provides an extra layer of protection for your backup solution.
