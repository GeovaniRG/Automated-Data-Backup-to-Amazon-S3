Performance optimization in the backup script:

Here's an example of how you can optimize the performance of the backup script:

```
import boto3
import sys
import gzip
import concurrent.futures

s3 = boto3.client("s3")

bucket_name = "your-bucket-name"
file_name = "backup.txt"
compressed_file_name = "backup.txt.gz"

try:
    with open(file_name, "rb") as f_in:
        with gzip.open(compressed_file_name, "wb") as f_out:
            f_out.writelines(f_in)
    
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
        future = executor.submit(s3.put_object, Bucket=bucket_name, Key=compressed_file_name, Body=open(compressed_file_name, "rb"))
        print("Uploading...")
        future.result()
        print("Backup successful")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: Backup file not found")
    sys.exit(1)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    sys.exit(1)
```
In this example, the script uses the concurrent.futures module to upload the compressed backup file to S3 in parallel, using a thread pool with 5 workers. This can help speed up the backup process, as the upload process can take advantage of multiple CPU cores, network connections, and disk I/O.

By optimizing the performance of the backup script, you can reduce the time it takes to complete the backup process, which can be especially important if you need to backup large amounts of data on a regular basis. This can help you meet your backup and disaster recovery SLAs and minimize downtime in case of data loss or corruption.
