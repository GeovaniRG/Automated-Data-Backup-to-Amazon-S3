Encryption in the backup script:

Here's an example of how you can add encryption to the backup script:

```
import boto3
import sys
import gzip
import boto3.s3.encryption

s3 = boto3.resource("s3")

bucket_name = "your-bucket-name"
file_name = "backup.txt"
compressed_file_name = "backup.txt.gz"

try:
    with open(file_name, "rb") as f_in:
        with gzip.open(compressed_file_name, "wb") as f_out:
            f_out.writelines(f_in)
    
    s3.Bucket(bucket_name).upload_file(compressed_file_name, compressed_file_name, 
                                        ExtraArgs={'ServerSideEncryption': 'AES256'})
    print("Backup successful")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: Backup file not found")
    sys.exit(1)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    sys.exit(1)
```
In this example, the script uses the ExtraArgs argument when uploading the compressed file to S3 to specify that the file should be encrypted using AES-256 encryption. The encryption is performed automatically by the S3 service, so there's no need for you to write any additional code to encrypt the data.

By encrypting the backup data, you can ensure that the data is secure and protected against unauthorized access, even if the data is intercepted during transit or while it is stored in S3. This provides an extra layer of security for your backup solution and helps you meet regulatory and compliance requirements.
