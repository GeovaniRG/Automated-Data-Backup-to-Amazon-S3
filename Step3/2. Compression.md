Compression in the backup script:

Here's an example of how you can add compression to the backup script:

```
import boto3
import sys
import gzip

s3 = boto3.resource("s3")

bucket_name = "your-bucket-name"
file_name = "backup.txt"
compressed_file_name = "backup.txt.gz"

try:
    with open(file_name, "rb") as f_in:
        with gzip.open(compressed_file_name, "wb") as f_out:
            f_out.writelines(f_in)
    
    s3.Bucket(bucket_name).upload_file(compressed_file_name, compressed_file_name)
    print("Backup successful")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: Backup file not found")
    sys.exit(1)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    sys.exit(1)
```

In this example, the script uses the gzip module to compress the backup file before uploading it to Amazon S3. The script opens the original backup file and the compressed file using the with statement, which ensures that the files are closed properly even if an exception is raised. The script then writes the contents of the original backup file to the compressed file using the writelines method. Finally, the script uploads the compressed file to S3 in the same way as before.

By compressing the backup data, you can reduce the size of the data, which in turn reduces the cost of storing the data in S3 and the cost of data transfer. This can help you save money on your AWS bill while still providing a secure and reliable backup solution.
