Error handling in the backup script:

Here's an example of how you can add error handling to the backup script:

```
import boto3
import sys

s3 = boto3.resource("s3")

bucket_name = "your-bucket-name"
file_name = "backup.txt"

try:
    s3.Bucket(bucket_name).upload_file(file_name, file_name)
    print("Backup successful")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: Backup file not found")
    sys.exit(1)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    sys.exit(1)
```

In this example, the script uses a try-except block to catch any exceptions that might occur during the backup process. If a FileNotFoundError is raised, the script logs an error message and exits with a status code of 1. If any other exception is raised, the script logs the error message and also exits with a status code of 1.

By handling exceptions in this way, you can ensure that the script runs smoothly and provides meaningful error messages if anything goes wrong. This makes it easier to diagnose and fix any problems that may arise during the backup process.
