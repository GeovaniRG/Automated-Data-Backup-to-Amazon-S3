Step 2: Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store the backup data
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console using the IAM user created in Step 1.
2. Go to the Amazon S3 service.
3. Click the "Create bucket" button.
4. Enter a unique bucket name, select the region where you want to store the data, and then click the "Create" button.
5. In the bucket properties, enable versioning by clicking the "Versioning" option and then selecting "Enabled". This will allow you to retain all versions of your backup data, even if it is overwritten.
6. Optionally, you can also configure other settings such as access control, encryption, and tags, to meet your specific requirements.
7. Click the "Create bucket" button to create the bucket.

This completes the second step of creating an Amazon S3 bucket to store the backup data. You can now proceed to the next steps of the project.

This step does not require any code. You can complete it through the AWS Management Console web interface. However, you can also use the Amazon S3 API to create a bucket programmatically using code in Python or any other programming language. If you want to do this, you will need to use the access key and secret access key from the IAM user created in Step 1 to authenticate the API requests.
