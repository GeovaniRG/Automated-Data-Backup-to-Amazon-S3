Step 1: Set up an AWS account and configure the necessary IAM roles
1. Sign up for an AWS account: To create an AWS account, go to the AWS website and follow the on-screen instructions.
2. Set up an IAM user: IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a service that enables you to manage access to AWS resources. To set up an IAM user, follow these steps:
    
    a. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    
    b. Go to the IAM service.
    
    c. Click on the "Users" menu, and then click the "Add user" button.
    
   
    d. Enter a user name, select "Programmatic access", and click the "Next: Permissions" button.
    
    e. Choose the "Attach existing policies directly" option, and select the "AmazonS3FullAccess" policy.
   
    
    f. Click the "Next: Review" button, and then click the "Create user" button.
    
    g. Download the CSV file that contains the access key and secret access key, which will be used to authenticate the Python script with AWS.
    
3. Verify the IAM user: To verify that the IAM user is set up correctly, follow these steps:
    
    a. Log in to the AWS Management Console using the new IAM user.
   
    b. Go to the Amazon S3 service, and click the "Create bucket" button to verify that the IAM user has the necessary permissions.

This completes the first step of setting up an AWS account and configuring the necessary IAM roles. You are now ready to proceed to the next steps of the project.
